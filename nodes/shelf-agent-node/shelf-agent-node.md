# Shelf Agent Node Documentation

## Overview
The `shelf-agent-node` is designed to manage smart shelves within a Node-RED flow. This node allows users to monitor and control smart shelves, typically used in inventory management systems. It can track the presence of items, manage stock levels, and trigger actions based on the shelf's status.

## Directory Structure

- **`shelf-agent.html`**: This file defines the user interface (UI) for configuring the `shelf-agent-node` in the Node-RED editor.
- **`shelf-agent.js`**: Contains the core logic and behavior of the `shelf-agent-node` in the Node-RED runtime.

## Detailed Explanation of Files

### 1. `shelf-agent.html`
This file sets up the Node-RED editor interface for the `shelf-agent-node`. It includes form elements that allow users to configure the shelf parameters, manage item tracking, and set up alerts for stock levels.

**Key Components**:
- **CSS Styling**: The file includes styles to ensure the UI components for managing smart shelves are visually consistent and user-friendly within the Node-RED editor.
- **Form Elements**: Users can input and adjust settings related to the shelf's operation, such as setting thresholds for stock levels, configuring alerts, and managing the shelf's inventory tracking.

### 2. `shelf-agent.js`
The JavaScript file implements the functionality of the `shelf-agent-node`. It handles the interactions with smart shelves, processes data related to the shelf's status, and triggers actions based on user configurations.

**Key Functions**:
- **Inventory Management**: The script tracks the items on the shelf, manages stock levels, and updates the inventory status within the Node-RED flow.
- **Alerting**: Users can configure the node to send alerts when stock levels drop below a certain threshold or when other conditions are met.

**Integration with Resources**:
- **`js_common_methods.js`**: This file may provide utility functions for managing inventory data, handling alerts, and processing shelf status updates. These shared methods ensure the node operates efficiently and consistently.
- **`html_common_methods.js`**: This file could be used in `shelf-agent.html` to standardize UI interactions, such as managing input fields for inventory settings and validating user input.

## Usage Example

### Adding the `shelf-agent-node` to a Flow
1. Drag the `shelf-agent-node` from the Node-RED palette into your flow.
2. Double-click the node to open its configuration UI.
3. Set the thresholds for stock levels, configure alerts, and manage inventory tracking settings.
4. Deploy the flow to start monitoring and managing your smart shelves automatically.

## Conclusion
The `shelf-agent-node` is a valuable tool for integrating smart shelf systems into your Node-RED environment. By leveraging shared resources and standardized methods, this node allows users to automate inventory management, ensuring optimal performance and efficient stock control.
