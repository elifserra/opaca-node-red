# Wayfinding Agent Node Documentation

## Overview
The `wayfinding-agent-node` is designed to assist with navigation and route finding within a Node-RED flow. This node enables users to calculate and provide directions or routes, making it an essential tool for applications that require navigation assistance, such as smart buildings or transportation systems.

## Directory Structure

- **`wayfinding-agent.html`**: This file defines the user interface (UI) for configuring the `wayfinding-agent-node` in the Node-RED editor.
- **`wayfinding-agent.js`**: Contains the core logic and behavior of the `wayfinding-agent-node` in the Node-RED runtime.

## Detailed Explanation of Files

### 1. `wayfinding-agent.html`
This file sets up the Node-RED editor interface for the `wayfinding-agent-node`. It includes form elements that allow users to configure navigation parameters, such as start and end points, route preferences, and integration with mapping services.

**Key Components**:
- **CSS Styling**: The file includes styles to ensure the UI components for navigation and route finding are visually consistent and user-friendly within the Node-RED editor.
- **Form Elements**: Users can input and adjust settings related to the wayfinding process, such as selecting destinations, configuring route preferences, and managing map integration.

### 2. `wayfinding-agent.js`
The JavaScript file implements the functionality of the `wayfinding-agent-node`. It handles the calculations for route finding, interacts with mapping services, and provides navigation instructions based on user configurations.

**Key Functions**:
- **Route Calculation**: The script calculates optimal routes between specified points, considering user preferences such as shortest or fastest routes.
- **Mapping Integration**: The node can interact with external mapping services to provide accurate and up-to-date route information.

**Integration with Resources**:
- **`js_common_methods.js`**: This file may provide utility functions for interacting with mapping APIs, handling route calculations, and processing navigation data. These shared methods ensure the node operates efficiently and consistently.
- **`html_common_methods.js`**: This file could be used in `wayfinding-agent.html` to standardize UI interactions, such as managing input fields for navigation settings and validating user input.

## Usage Example

### Adding the `wayfinding-agent-node` to a Flow
1. Drag the `wayfinding-agent-node` from the Node-RED palette into your flow.
2. Double-click the node to open its configuration UI.
3. Set the start and end points, configure route preferences, and integrate with your chosen mapping service.
4. Deploy the flow to provide navigation assistance and route finding within your Node-RED environment.

## Conclusion
The `wayfinding-agent-node` is an essential tool for applications that require navigation and route finding. By leveraging shared resources and standardized methods, this node allows users to calculate routes and provide navigation instructions seamlessly within Node-RED, making it a powerful addition to any flow that involves wayfinding.
