# Camera Node Documentation

## Overview
The `camera-node` is designed to interface with camera devices within the Node-RED environment. It allows users to capture images, stream video, and process visual data within their Node-RED flows. This node is particularly useful for applications involving image recognition, surveillance, or any scenario where visual input is required.

## Directory Structure

- **`camera.html`**: Defines the user interface (UI) for configuring the `camera-node` within the Node-RED editor.
- **`camera.js`**: Implements the logic and behavior of the `camera-node` in the Node-RED runtime, handling tasks such as initializing the camera, capturing images, and processing video streams.

## Detailed Explanation of Files

### 1. `camera.html`
This file sets up the Node-RED editor interface for the `camera-node`. It includes elements for configuring camera settings, such as resolution, frame rate, and other parameters relevant to image and video capture.

**Key Components**:
- **Video and Canvas Elements**: The HTML includes `<video>` and `<canvas>` elements for displaying the live camera feed and capturing images.
- **Form Elements**: Input fields and buttons allow users to start/stop the camera, capture images, and adjust settings directly from the Node-RED UI.

**Example UI Elements**:
```html
<video id="webcam" autoplay playsinline width="800" height="640"></video>
<canvas id="canvas" width="800" height="640" style="display: none;"></canvas>
<button id="captureButton">Capture Photo</button>
```

### 2. `camera.js`
The JavaScript file implements the runtime logic for the `camera-node`. It handles tasks such as:
- Initializing the camera and streaming the video feed to the `<video>` element.
- Capturing images and rendering them onto the `<canvas>` element.
- Processing the captured data and sending it through the Node-RED flow.

**Key Functions**:
- **`Camera` Class**: This class likely encapsulates all the logic for interacting with the camera. It includes methods for opening the camera stream, capturing images, and closing the stream when no longer needed.
- **`RED.nodes.registerType("camera", CameraNode)`**: Registers the `camera-node` within Node-RED, making it available for use in flows.

**Example Methods**:
- **`openCamera()`**: Initializes the camera and starts streaming video.
- **`captureImage()`**: Captures an image from the video stream and processes it as required.
- **`closeCamera()`**: Closes the camera stream when the node is no longer in use.

## Integration with Resources

### 1. `js_common_methods.js`
This file may be imported within `camera.js` to provide shared methods for handling tasks like configuration, error handling, and communication with external services. By using common methods, the project ensures that the camera node behaves consistently with other nodes.

### 2. `html_common_methods.js`
Used in `camera.html` to standardize the creation and manipulation of HTML elements within the Node-RED editor. This helps maintain a consistent UI/UX across different nodes.

## Usage Example

### Adding the `camera-node` to a Flow
1. Drag the `camera-node` from the Node-RED palette into your flow.
2. Double-click the node to open its configuration UI.
3. Adjust the camera settings, such as resolution and frame rate.
4. Deploy the flow to start capturing and processing images within Node-RED.

### Practical Application
- **Surveillance Systems**: Use the `camera-node` to monitor and capture images from a security camera.
- **Image Recognition**: Integrate the `camera-node` with image recognition services to analyze captured images and trigger actions based on detected objects.

## Conclusion
The `camera-node` is a versatile tool in the Node-RED environment, providing the capability to work with visual data. Its integration with shared resources ensures that it functions smoothly within complex flows, offering users a powerful way to incorporate camera functionality into their Node-RED projects.
