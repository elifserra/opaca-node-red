## Overview

The `KnowledgeAgent` node is designed to interface with a language model specialized in providing information related to Berlin's administration, local events, attractions, and more. It allows users to ask questions and receive relevant information or assistance with administrative tasks in Berlin.

## Node Functionality

### Actions

1. **AskKnowledgeLLM**
   - **Description:** This action forwards a question to a specialized language model capable of answering queries related to Berlin's administration. The model can provide information about local events, attractions, assist in searching for relevant documents and forms, and help in booking appointments with the Berlin administration. It is important to include all necessary details in the question to ensure the model can generate the best possible answer.
   - **Parameters:**
     - `question` (string, required): The question you want to ask the language model. Ensure that it contains all relevant information for a precise response.
   - **Result:**
     - `string`: The response generated by the language model, answering the question posed.

## Implementation

### JavaScript File (KnowledgeAgent.js)

```javascript
const imports = require('../../nodes/resources/imports.js');
const js_common_methods = imports.js_common_methods_import;

module.exports = function(RED) {
    function KnowledgeAgentNode(config) {
        js_common_methods.makeNodeConfiguration(RED, this, config);
    }
    RED.nodes.registerType("KnowledgeAgent", KnowledgeAgentNode);
}
```

### HTML File (KnowledgeAgent.html)

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="html_common_methods.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
    makeNodeRegistration("KnowledgeAgent");
</script>
```

## Usage

To use the `KnowledgeAgent` node in Node-RED, drag and drop it from the palette into your workspace. Configure the required parameters by specifying the question you wish to ask. Connect it to other nodes as needed to integrate with broader workflows or systems.

## Notes

- Ensure that the language model service is properly configured and accessible from the Node-RED environment.
- The node uses common methods shared across similar agent nodes, which simplifies its configuration and registration within Node-RED.
- The quality of the model's response largely depends on how well the question is formulated; including all necessary context is crucial.

This documentation provides an overview of how to use the `KnowledgeAgent` node effectively within your Node-RED environment.
