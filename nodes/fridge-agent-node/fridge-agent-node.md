# Fridge Agent Node Documentation

## Overview
The `fridge-agent-node` is designed to interact with smart refrigerator systems within the Node-RED environment. It allows users to monitor and manage the status of smart fridges, such as tracking temperature, managing inventory, and triggering alerts or actions based on specific conditions.

## Directory Structure

- **`fridge-agent.html`**: Defines the user interface (UI) for configuring the `fridge-agent-node` within the Node-RED editor.
- **`fridge-agent.js`**: Implements the logic and behavior of the `fridge-agent-node` in the Node-RED runtime, handling tasks such as temperature monitoring, inventory management, and event triggering.

## Detailed Explanation of Files

### 1. `fridge-agent.html`
This file sets up the Node-RED editor interface for the `fridge-agent-node`. It includes elements for configuring fridge-related settings, such as temperature thresholds, inventory alerts, and other parameters relevant to the management of smart refrigerators.

**Key Components**:
- **Form Elements**: Input fields, sliders, and buttons allow users to configure the node's behavior. Users can set temperature limits, specify inventory items, and define actions that should be triggered when certain conditions are met.

**Example UI Elements**:
```html
<div class="form-row">
    <label for="node-input-temperature"><i class="fa fa-thermometer-half"></i> Temperature Threshold</label>
    <input type="number" id="node-input-temperature" placeholder="Set temperature threshold">
</div>
<div class="form-row">
    <label for="node-input-inventory"><i class="fa fa-list"></i> Inventory Items</label>
    <input type="text" id="node-input-inventory" placeholder="Enter inventory items">
</div>
```

### 2. `fridge-agent.js`
The JavaScript file implements the runtime logic for the `fridge-agent-node`. It handles tasks such as:
- Monitoring the temperature inside the fridge and comparing it to the set threshold.
- Managing inventory, including adding or removing items and tracking their status.
- Triggering alerts or actions when specific conditions are met, such as when the temperature exceeds a certain limit or when inventory is low.

**Key Functions**:
- **Temperature Monitoring**: The node may include methods for continuously monitoring the fridge's temperature and triggering alerts if it deviates from the set threshold.
- **Inventory Management**: Methods for adding, removing, and tracking inventory items, ensuring that the fridge is properly stocked and that users are alerted when items need to be restocked.

**Example Methods**:
- **`monitorTemperature()`**: Continuously monitors the fridge's temperature and triggers an alert if it exceeds the specified threshold.
- **`manageInventory()`**: Handles the addition, removal, and tracking of inventory items within the fridge.

## Integration with Resources

### 1. `js_common_methods.js`
This file may be imported within `fridge-agent.js` to provide shared methods for tasks such as data validation, event handling, and logging. By using common methods, the project ensures that the fridge agent node behaves consistently with other nodes.

### 2. `html_common_methods.js`
Used in `fridge-agent.html` to standardize the creation and manipulation of HTML elements within the Node-RED editor, ensuring a consistent user experience.

## Usage Example

### Adding the `fridge-agent-node` to a Flow
1. Drag the `fridge-agent-node` from the Node-RED palette into your flow.
2. Double-click the node to open its configuration UI.
3. Set the temperature threshold, define inventory items, and specify any actions that should be triggered based on conditions.
4. Deploy the flow to start monitoring and managing the smart fridge.

### Practical Application
- **Temperature Alerts**: Use the `fridge-agent-node` to monitor the fridge's temperature and trigger an alert if it exceeds the specified threshold, helping to prevent spoilage.
- **Inventory Management**: Automatically track the fridge's inventory and receive notifications when items are running low, ensuring that the fridge is always properly stocked.

## Conclusion
The `fridge-agent-node` is a versatile tool for managing smart refrigerator systems within the Node-RED environment. Its ability to monitor temperature, manage inventory, and trigger alerts makes it an essential component for applications where maintaining optimal fridge conditions is critical.
