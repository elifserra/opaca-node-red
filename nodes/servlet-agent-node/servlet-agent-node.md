# Servlet Agent Node Documentation

## Overview
The `servlet-agent-node` is designed to interact with servlet-based web services within a Node-RED flow. This node enables users to send requests and receive responses from servlets, making it a crucial tool for integrating web-based services into their automation workflows.

## Directory Structure

- **`servlet-agent.html`**: This file defines the user interface (UI) for configuring the `servlet-agent-node` in the Node-RED editor.
- **`servlet-agent.js`**: Contains the core logic and behavior of the `servlet-agent-node` in the Node-RED runtime.

## Detailed Explanation of Files

### 1. `servlet-agent.html`
This file is responsible for setting up the Node-RED editor interface for the `servlet-agent-node`. It includes form elements that allow users to configure the connection to servlet-based services, specify the endpoints, and define the request parameters.

**Key Components**:
- **CSS Styling**: The file includes styles to ensure the UI components for servlet interactions are visually consistent and easy to use within the Node-RED editor.
- **Form Elements**: Users can input the necessary details, such as servlet URL, HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.), and any required headers or body content for the request.

### 2. `servlet-agent.js`
The JavaScript file implements the logic for the `servlet-agent-node`. It manages the communication with servlet-based services, sending requests according to the configuration and processing the responses within the Node-RED flow.

**Key Functions**:
- **Request Handling**: The script sends HTTP requests to the specified servlet, handles the response, and forwards the data within the flow. This includes managing different HTTP methods and handling any errors that may arise.
- **Data Processing**: The node processes the data received from the servlet, allowing it to be used by other nodes in the flow.

**Integration with Resources**:
- **`js_common_methods.js`**: This file may provide utility functions for managing HTTP requests, processing responses, and handling errors. These shared methods ensure the node operates efficiently and consistently.
- **`html_common_methods.js`**: This file could be used in `servlet-agent.html` to standardize UI interactions, such as managing input fields for request configuration and validating user input.

## Usage Example

### Adding the `servlet-agent-node` to a Flow
1. Drag the `servlet-agent-node` from the Node-RED palette into your flow.
2. Double-click the node to open its configuration UI.
3. Enter the servlet URL, select the HTTP method, and configure any additional parameters required for the request.
4. Deploy the flow to enable communication with servlet-based services as part of your automation workflow.

## Conclusion
The `servlet-agent-node` is a powerful tool for integrating servlet-based web services into Node-RED. By leveraging shared resources and standardized methods, this node ensures reliable and efficient communication with web services, making it an essential component for users looking to extend the capabilities of their Node-RED flows.
