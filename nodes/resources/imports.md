# Imports Documentation

## Overview
The `imports.js` file serves as a centralized hub for importing and exporting the necessary modules, files, and paths used throughout the Node-RED project. By consolidating these imports in a single file, the project remains organized and maintainable.

## Purpose
This file aims to streamline the management of dependencies by providing a single location from which all required resources can be imported. This approach reduces redundancy, avoids errors, and simplifies the process of updating or modifying dependencies.

## Key Imports and Exports

### 1. **Paths**
- **repository_path_import**: The path to the root of the repository.
- **common_methods_path**: The path to `js_common_methods.js`.
- **html_common_methods_path_import**: The path to `html_common_methods.js`.
- **common_html_template_path_import**: The path to `common_html_template.html`.
- **node_config_file_path_import**: The path to `node_config.json`.
- **package_json_file_path_import**: The path to `package.json`.
- **object_detection_path_import**: The path to `ObjectDetection.js` used in the camera node.

### 2. **Modules**
- **js_common_methods_import**: Imports the common JavaScript methods from `js_common_methods.js`.
- **file_system_import**: Imports Node.js's file system (`fs`) module for handling file operations.

### 3. **URLs**
- **apiUrl_import**: The base URL for API requests.
- **loginUrl_import**: The URL for logging into the server.

## Usage
This file is used across various nodes and scripts in the project to ensure that all necessary resources are correctly imported and available. By centralizing these imports, the project minimizes the risk of inconsistent imports or path errors, making the codebase more robust and easier to work with.
