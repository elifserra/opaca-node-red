# OPACA Framework Node-RED Integration

## Overview

This project integrates the OPACA framework agens with Node-RED, a visual programming tool that allows for the flow-based development of applications. In this project, each Node-RED node represents a specific agent from the OPACA framework. These agents perform various roles, such as managing data exchange, interacting with external systems, and automating tasks. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how the OPACA framework can be effectively utilized within Node-RED to create a dynamic, responsive system.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple directories, each corresponding to a particular agent or utility within the OPACA framework. These directories contain the necessary logic to define the behavior of each agent when represented as a Node-RED node. Below is a detailed description of each module:

### 1. **BaseAgent**
   - **Purpose:** This agent is not directly a opaca agent. This agent actually can be any opaca agent depending on the selected agent id by user.
   - **Role in Node-RED:** It has an input filed called as Agent ID. User can select the agent based on agent id. With the help of `opaca-access` node current agents are shown in the dropdown menu on the BaseAgent edit dialog. If new agent is added to stystem. User can use this node to use this new agent. However, if the user wants to use this new agent as a distinct node, user should create this agent node. Normally creating new agent node consists of creating two files. One of them is with .hmtl extension, the other is with .js extension. Thanks to `NodeCreator` node, user can automatically add new agent as NODE-RED node by filling the input fields of `NodeCreator` edit dialog.

### 10. **RoomBookingAgent**
   - **Purpose:** Manages room booking and scheduling, providing a system for reserving and managing shared spaces.
   - **Role in Node-RED:** Integrates room scheduling into Node-RED flows, allowing for automated booking and management within the OPACA framework.
   - [Detailed Documentation](./RoomBookingAgent.md)

### 11. **ServletAgent**
   - **Purpose:** Provides servlet-based interactions, enabling web-based control and monitoring of the system.
   - **Role in Node-RED:** Integrates web interfaces with the OPACA framework, allowing for browser-based management of system components.

## Prerequisites

### Node-RED Installation

To use this project, you need to have Node-RED installed. Node-RED is essential for deploying and interacting with the OPACA framework agents as nodes.

1. **Install Node-RED:**
   - Node-RED can be installed on various operating systems. Follow the instructions on the [Node-RED official website](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/) to install it.

2. **Start Node-RED:**
   - After installation, run Node-RED by entering `node-red` in your terminal. The Node-RED editor will be accessible at `http://localhost:1880`.

3. **Deploy the Project:**
   - Import the provided JSON flow files into Node-RED and deploy them. These flows represent the interactions and operations of the OPACA agents within the Node-RED environment.

## Usage

Once Node-RED is running and the agents are deployed, you can interact with the system through the Node-RED dashboard or via direct API calls. Each agent is designed to perform specific tasks within the OPACA framework, making it easier to manage and automate complex environments.
